	<h1>Confounding Tools</h1>
	<p>For my first project this semester, I was tasked with developing a large-format 2D composition inspired by some aspect of my life under COVID19.<br> I decided to designate this assignment to expressing the ways in which I began learning about myself over the COVID19 quarantine.</p>

	<h2>Stage 1</h2>
	<p2 class="stage1para">In stage one I decided on using Google’s version of Microsoft Excel to assemble my design, and this was the stage where I also chose my topic; designs I created over covid as manifestations of self <br>discovery. This was my first crack at using non-design-oriented software to create any visual composition and so I spent this stage on seeing what is initially possible and where I may be able to push<br> the capabilities of the software to fit what I need. The visual form in the example from this stage’s exploration comes in two forms: the coloured cells and my actual raw designs. While initially these<br>coloured cells were meant to provide more context to the composition of my designs, it was through the first critique that the idea of using the coloured cells to repurpose the raw information <br>(my designs). This played a big part in the early developments of my poster.</p2>

	<h2>Stage 2</h2>
	<p2 class="stage2para">Come stage two I made the switch to Microsoft’s Excel as I found it to feel like a much sturdier software, one that I could more easily bounce off to understand my faults. I began to realize that I am<br> restricted as to what I could do with each cell. At first, I wanted to paste my images inside each cell, and maximize each version of the image to piece it together in a lower resolution. I then realized<br> that I had abilities to change the width of each column and row, I set the parameters equal and began plotting down colours to create a pixel art effect which would resemble the original piece. With<br> regards to visual composition of my form, this stage was not the highlight in that department. After reinterpreting my work through Excel, I arranged two variations with the intentions of exploring how<br> these newfound pixel designs look amongst each other. In retrospect I am glad I took this room to breathe as it allowed me to sit with what I have and realize that some of the images I had reinterpreted <br>just didn’t visually make sense next to the others, and so they were removed in the coming stage.</p2>

	<h2>Stage 3</h2>
	<p2 class="stage3para">Stage 3 is where I would take my first big crack at exploring different compositions with my new pixel designs. A few pixel designs did not visually fit with the rest and so I reinterpreted what was 3 new pieces to use. <br>One of them (the majority white one) would still be later removed after further consideration. In stage 3 I started by fitting my work into 3 different rectangular compositions which I also made sure cooperated with <br>my means of printing (Adobe InDesign). Exploring further, I tested out 3 different methods to go about vignetting my design to provide a cave or hole aesthetic to better represent the connection between my self<br> discovery and physical material discovery underground. My goal for the composition was too visual represent going down a whole, guided by my interested which naturally manifested into the designs I worked on over<br> the past years under vid’s occupation. Over those years I was not outside very much like many, and in a way, I went into my own little hole underground to better understand and develop who I am as a person. I was <br>curious to see how my project would fare if I were to print it at this stage. I dropped it into an InDesign file with the proper bleed and trim and figured the overall design fit too short with some room at the bottom so I wanted<br> to fill this space either with more and better form or something to provide more context since as of now my work is sort of bare of meaning. One good thing to come out of this test is confirming that exporting to pdf from <br>excel maintains quality, unlike my screenshotting method from stage 1.</p2>
